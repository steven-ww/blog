<p>Java memory utilization and settings when running in Kubernetes/Containers has come a long way in the recent versions of Java.</p>

<p>The <em>MaxRAMPercentage</em> option is one that is of particular note as it allows you to configure the percentage of the available container/pod memory that the Java heap can use. That allows you to scale up/down your pod memory without requiring changes to your JVM options to make use of the memory.<br/>
    <br/>
    Without any JVM options specified, the Heap will use no more than 25% of the available memory.</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>



<p>Given that, it was strange to me that one of the services I&#39;m working with at the moment was using a lot more memory than the 25% default. (No JVM options for memory were specified)</p>

<p>In this case, 4GB was allocated to the pod, which means the heap could be no bigger than 1GB and yet the memory use on the pod as reported by K8s was often over 3GB.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My first instinct was to give the JVM more of the available memory, so I set the <em>MaxRAMPercentage</em> to 75%.&nbsp; It wasn&#39;t long before this ended up in an Out Of Memory error in K8s and a restart of the pod...
</p>

<p>Okay, so giving more of the available memory to the heap caused the pod to exceed its 4GB limit. There was no other process running in the container, but surely the JVM itself couldn&#39;t be using 2GB of non-heap memory?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Logging the non-heap memory as reported by the&nbsp; API MemoryMXBean showed only 200K being used by non-heap processes. So what K8s was reporting still didn&#39;t add up.
</p>

<h3>The Solution&nbsp;</h3>

<p><br/>
    That&#39;s when I discovered java&#39;s&nbsp;<span><em>Native Memory Tracking</em> capability. By starting the JVM with the&nbsp;<em>-XX:NativeMemoryTracking=summary</em> option and then using jcmd (ships with the jdk) to run&nbsp; </span></p>

<pre>
    <code class="language-bash">jcmd &lt;pid&gt; VM.native_memory summary</code>
</pre>

<p>you can get a great view of the native memory being used by your Java process.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example (It also shows code, GC, compiler and other items using memory)</p>

<pre>
    <code class="language-bash">
Total: reserved=7106943KB, committed=4791151KB

Java Heap (reserved=3145728KB, committed=2097152KB)
     (mmap: reserved=3145728KB, committed=2097152KB)

Thread (reserved=2312368KB, committed=2312368KB)
     (thread #1122)
     (stack: reserved=2309260KB, committed=2309260KB)
     (malloc=1795KB #6747)
     (arena=1313KB #2241)
    </code>
</pre>

<p>As you can see from the above, I found the culprit that was using so much memory outside of the heap. Over a thousand threads had been created and they were using over 2GB of memory.&nbsp;<br/>
    <br/>
    So I finally had a true view of what memory my Java service was using and how that was being measured by K8s.&nbsp;<br/>
    <br/>
    The Java Native Memory tracker can also give you a more detailed view of which methods are using the most memory. Use the same options and commands as above, just replace <em>summary</em> with <em>detail</em>.
</p>

<p>You can also use it to track down memory leaks by first getting a baseline of the application after a warmup and then running a diff against that baseline.</p>
